PixelForge Nexus
PixelForge Nexus is a secure, full-stack web application designed as a project management system for a fictional game development company, "Creative SkillZ LLC". Built with the MERN stack, its primary purpose is to provide a centralized platform for managing projects, teams, and documents while enforcing a strict, role-based security model.

‚ú® Features
Role-Based Access Control: Three distinct user roles (Admin, Project Lead, Developer) with specific permissions.

Secure Authentication: User login system secured with JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and password hashing using bcrypt.

Project Management: Admins can create, delete, and manage the lifecycle of projects.

Team Management: Admins can create and delete user accounts. Project Leads can assign and unassign developers to their specific projects.

Document Management: Authorized users can upload and delete project-related documents.

Dynamic UI: The user interface, built with React, dynamically changes to show only the information and controls relevant to the logged-in user's role.
